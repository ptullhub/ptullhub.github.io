    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
  
    <!--  Replace this paragraph with your bio/about information.  -->
    <p> Hey there! My name is Peyton Tull and this is the part where I tell you a bit about myself.
      I am originally from New Jersey. I have a brother who is too good at smash brothers 
      and a dog whom I love dearly. I have an immense love for gaming as a whole, whether it be board games, video games, or tabletop RPG's. 
      I am an avid DND player and it is definitely what sparked my interest in both game design and development
    </p>
    <p> As for my career goals, I hope to one day make games that I can look back on and be proud of. It doesn't matter if they are big or small,
      simple or complex, short or long, as long as they bring entertainment and memories like the ones I have of gaming growing up. I have worked 
      with some very talented people thusofar and I definitely want to enter the industry as a programmer. Thank you for taking some 
      time to look at my stuff!
    </p>
